            <p class="center-text">Swaine Chen is a Group Leader in Infectious Diseases at the Genome Institute of Singapore and an Associate Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore. He has a broad background in medicine, biology, and chemistry. He is also a dedicated educator and science communicator. In his lab, he studies not only why some bacteria cause infections, but also tries to develop new methods so that we can diseases more quickly in the future. Another major aspect of his work is using DNA sequencing to detect and understand outbreaks of infectious diseases.</p>

            <p class="center-text">Majid Eshaghi is a postdoc whoâ€™s main research interest lies in molecular microbiology and synthetic biology. He obtained his PhD from UPM, Malaysia. His current project focuses on developing novel tools and strategies to bypass the E. coli cell envelope to study protein interactions and antibiotic resistance.</p>

            <h1 class="center-text medium-margin">Kurosh Mehershahi</h1>
            <p class="center-text">Kurosh Mehershahi is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab whose research focus is microbial pathogenesis, working towards shedding light on virulence mechanisms employed by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli and food-borne Streptococcus agalactiae. He completed his PhD from National University of Singapore (2017) studying the role of epigenetics (DNA methylation) in E. coli. He is passionate about deciphering the precise spatio-temporal events which bestow upon a bacterium its pathogenic potential; using not only classical microbial genetics and animal models, but also next generation sequencing technologies.</p>
