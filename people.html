            <p class="center-text">Swaine Chen is a Group Leader in Infectious Diseases at the Genome Institute of Singapore and an Associate Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore. He has a broad background in medicine, biology, and chemistry. He is also a dedicated educator and science communicator. In his lab, he studies not only why some bacteria cause infections, but also tries to develop new methods so that we can diseases more quickly in the future. Another major aspect of his work is using DNA sequencing to detect and understand outbreaks of infectious diseases.</p>

            <p class="center-text">Majid Eshaghi is a postdoc whoâ€™s main research interest lies in molecular microbiology and synthetic biology. He obtained his PhD from UPM, Malaysia. His current project focuses on developing novel tools and strategies to bypass the E. coli cell envelope to study protein interactions and antibiotic resistance.</p>

            <p class="center-text">How can we truly increase the pace of research discovery?<br/>Not all infectious diseases have good model systems. However, we can collect DNA sequence from nearly any organism. Can we leverage computational techniques, using only DNA sequences, to gain mechanistic insights into infectious diseases? This would truly increase our ability to understand and combat disease.</p>

            <p class="mega-margin">Experimentally, we work on two main systems: urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and invasive foodborne infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus). We also have some explicitly computational projects which are exploring how bacteria, and their ability to cause disease, evolves. We also have interests in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and synthetic biology. Click below for more details!</p>
