            <p class="center-text mega-margin">We are working to integrate modern sequencing and computational methods into the daily discovery process of microbiologists.<br>
Urinary tract infections caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i> are a major unmet disease need which we study in detail. The UTI model system also serves as a testbed for developing sequencing-powered methods that could be applied to other infectious diseases.<br>
Research in the lab falls into three major themes:</p>

            <p class="center-text small-side-margin">
              <b><i>Molecular interactions underly disease.</i></b><br><br>
              We need to understand these molecular details in order to treat or prevent infections. Urinary tract infections and foodborne Group B Streptococcus disease are our main experimental models.</p>

            <p class="center-text small-side-margin">
              <b><i>Genetic techniques are needed to understand bacteria causing disease today.</i></b><br>
              Traditional genetic methods have been developed for specific lab-adapted strains. We are forging new technologies to manipulate strains that are cuasing dieasese in humans today. These techniques are always more general and sometimes more powerful as well.</p>

            <p class="center-text small-side-margin">
              <b><i>How can we increase the pace of discovery?</b></i><br><br>
              Not all infectious diseases have good model systems. However, we can collect DNA sequence from nearly any organism. Can we leverage computational techniques, using only DNA sequences, to gain mechanistic insights into infectious diseases? This would truly increase our ability to understand and combat disease.</p>

            <p class="mega-margin">Experimentally, we work on two main systems: urinary tract infections caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i> and invasive foodborne infections caused by <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> (Group B Streptococcus). We also have some explicitly computational projects which are exploring how bacteria, and their ability to cause disease, evolves. We also have interests in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and synthetic biology. Click below for more details!</p>
