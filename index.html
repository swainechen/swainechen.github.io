            <p class="center-text mega-margin">We are working to integrate high-throughput sequencing technologies into the daily discovery process of microbiologists.<br>
Urinary tract infections caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i> are a major unmet disease need which we study in detail; but these also serve as a testbed for developing sequencing-powered methods that could be applied to many other infectious diseases.<br>
Research in the lab falls into three major themes:</p>

            <img src="assets/mouse.png" alt="In vivo emoji" class="emoji-img center-margin large-margin">
            <h1 class="center-text medium-margin">In vivo</h1>
            <p class="center-text">Molecular interactions enable bacteria to cause disease.<br/>We need to understand these molecular details in order to treat or prevent infections. Urinary tract infections and foodborne Group B Streptococcus disease are our main experimental models.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Grid-cell u-size1of3 emoji-card">
            <img src="assets/petri-dish.png" alt="In vitro emoji" class="emoji-img center-margin large-margin">
            <h1 class="center-text medium-margin">In vitro</h1>
            <p class="center-text">Genetic techniques are needed to understand bacteria causing disease today.<br/>Traditional genetic methods have been developed for specific lab-adapted strains. We are forging new technologies to manipulate strains that are cuasing dieasese in humans today. These techniques are always more general and sometimes more powerful as well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Grid-cell u-size1of3 emoji-card">
            <img src="assets/computer.png" alt="In silico emoji" class="emoji-img center-margin large-margin">
            <h1 class="center-text medium-margin">In silico</h1>
            <p class="center-text">How can we truly increase the pace of research discovery?<br/>Not all infectious diseases have good model systems. However, we can collect DNA sequence from nearly any organism. Can we leverage computational techniques, using only DNA sequences, to gain mechanistic insights into infectious diseases? This would truly increase our ability to understand and combat disease.</p>

            <p class="mega-margin">Experimentally, we work on two main systems: urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and invasive foodborne infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus). We also have some explicitly computational projects which are exploring how bacteria, and their ability to cause disease, evolves. We also have interests in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and synthetic biology. Click below for more details!</p>
