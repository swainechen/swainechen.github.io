## 2024-05-23 - Mitigation of Reverse Tabnabbing
**Vulnerability:** External links using `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener noreferrer"` allowed the target page to potentially access the `window.opener` object of the original page.
**Learning:** This vulnerability was present in static HTML templates, dynamically created DOM elements in JavaScript, and even in `window.open` calls.
**Prevention:** Always include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (or `noopener,noreferrer` in `window.open` features) for any link that opens in a new tab.

## 2026-03-04 - Defense in Depth: Hardening against XSS and Inline Scripts
**Vulnerability:** Potential XSS from external HTML data injected via `innerHTML` and security risks from inline `onclick` handlers.
**Learning:** Using `innerHTML` for data from external APIs (like GitHub) is dangerous. Even if the source is currently trusted, it's a point of failure. Inline `onclick` handlers violate CSP best practices and are less maintainable than semantic `<a>` tags or `addEventListener`.
**Prevention:** Use `DOMParser` to safely extract text content from external HTML strings. Replace inline `onclick` navigation with semantic `<a>` tags and appropriate `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links.
